"Your Honor, years ago I recognized my kinship with all living beings, and 
I made up my mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. 
I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, 
and while there is a criminal element I am of it, and while there is a 
soul in prison, I am not free." -Eugene V. Debs
